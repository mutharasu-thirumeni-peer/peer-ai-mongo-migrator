Welcome! I'll show you how our AI agent analyzes, transforms, and migrates databases in real-time.

First, our agent connects to PostgreSQL and performs deep schema analysis. It extracts 22 tables, discovers 18 semantic relationships.

Now watch the magic! The agent automatically transforms the relational schema into MongoDB collections with proper indexing.

The agent also analyzes GitHub repositories to understand migration patterns.

These screenshots show PostgreSQL analysis, MongoDB conversion, and GitHub analysis. You can see the detailed table structures, the automatic conversion to MongoDB collections with embedded documents, and the repository analysis showing Spring Boot patterns and migration insights.

You've seen how our AI agent can analyze schemas, generate MongoDB equivalents, and integrate with GitHub. This is the future of database management!
